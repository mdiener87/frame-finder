## Resource Requirements

### Development Resources
- 1 Python developer (full-stack)
- 1 UI/UX designer (part-time)
- 1 QA tester (part-time)

### Infrastructure
- Development machine with:
  - 8GB+ RAM
  - Multi-core CPU
  - GPU (recommended)
  - 10GB+ free storage

### Third-party Services
- Hugging Face model hub (free tier)
- GitHub for version control (free tier)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. CLIP model integration complexity
   - Mitigation: Start with simpler models, add CLIP later
2. Video processing performance issues
   - Mitigation: Implement batching and progress tracking
3. Memory usage during processing
   - Mitigation: Process videos sequentially, clear memory

### Schedule Risks
1. Dependency on third-party libraries
   - Mitigation: Have fallback implementations
2. Hardware limitations affecting development
   - Mitigation: Develop with performance constraints in mind

### Quality Risks
1. Inaccurate image matching
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing with various inputs
2. Poor user experience
   - Mitigation: Regular user feedback sessions

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Processing speed (frames/second)
- Accuracy of matches (manual verification)
- Memory usage during processing
- Error rate in file processing

### User Experience Metrics
- Time to complete analysis
- User satisfaction score
