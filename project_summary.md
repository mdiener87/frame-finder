# Frame-Finder Analyzer Improvement Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project aims to significantly enhance the frame-finder analyzer's performance, accuracy, and user experience. The current implementation has been proven useful but has several areas for improvement identified through analysis and user feedback.

## Current State Analysis

The existing frame-finder analyzer has the following characteristics:

### Strengths
- Functional CLIP-based image comparison
- Simple and intuitive web interface
- Support for multiple reference images and videos
- Basic frame extraction and comparison pipeline

### Weaknesses
- No GPU acceleration utilization
- Redundant computation of reference embeddings
- No support for negative references
- Fixed confidence threshold
- No temporal clustering of detections
- Limited preprocessing of images
- No real-time feedback during processing
- Integer-only frame interval selection

## Improvement Areas

   - Reduce false positive rate by 30%+

3. **Temporal Clustering**
   - Cluster hits within ±1 second time windows
   - Keep highest-scoring frame per cluster
   - Reduce duplicate detections due to wobble

4. **Adaptive Thresholding**

   - CLIP re-check only for candidates
   - Reduce CLIP processing by 70%+

3. **Micro-Tuning Around Peaks**
   - Rescan ±2s at higher FPS (4 fps) when candidate detected
   - Keep frame with maximum score
   - Improve temporal precision of detections

### User Experience Enhancements
