# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

- The `main` branch is actively developed and supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
- If the repository has GitHub Security Advisories enabled (once public), prefer opening a private advisory via: Security → Advisories → “Report a vulnerability”.
- If advisories are not available, please contact the maintainers privately (preferred contact will be added to the README or repo description once public).

We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe and keep you informed about the fix progress and disclosure plan.
